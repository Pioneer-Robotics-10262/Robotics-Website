 <h1>Attention!</h1>
<h2>Hello! A a quick update,we have qualified for the South-Eastern Michigan State Championships the weekend of December 13th, 2025. As a result we are very busy preparing and practicing for this major advancement! </h2>

<h1>Who We Are</h1>
 
<p> The Pioneer Red Panthers, FTC Team 10262, is part of the Pioneer Middle School Robotics Club from Plymouth, Michigan. Before COVID, our club consisted of three teams, but currently we just have one. We went to two competitions, one in Bedford and the other in Goodrich last year. At the competitions, we had a lot of fun (especially while pin hunting in the pits). We also had fun during the actual competition because it was exciting competing the second year with more experience. We didn’t win every match, but we did well and we got better the more we participated. We did a great job with the presentation as well.</p>

<p>We worked hard over the last year to get new members on the team. We have thirteen members this year, almost double the members from last year. Five members are returning seventh graders. They all enjoyed the experience and are hoping to get a win at one of our competitions. We have have six rookies in training – One new member in eighth grade, two new members in seventh grade and two new sixth graders. Everyone is catching on very quickly and having a fun time getting to know robotics and each other.</p>

<p>We meet two days a week in the evenings at Canton High School and sometimes more as our competition get closer. Other teams from Plymouth-Canton also meet in the space as well. It is helpful to talk to each other, borrow parts, and do scrimmages to prepare for our events. We always think about Gracious Professionalism when we work together and share our ideas, spaces, and materials.  Some of the high school students are available to help and mentor us at the high school, too.  We have been able to learn a lot from them. </p>
